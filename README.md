// Setup the layout page that can be share with all the component in  the project and also add reactbits.dev UI to make  a light green sopt light backgrounf and then wrap the {children} in the main folder !

// Then we make a section to use  page.tsx file to make explore button and other feature also make the Lightrays feature absolute so that it can't distrub any other component and there position

In development mode, you can see code changes reflected instantly without reloading the entire page â€” thanks to HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

In Next.js, the Next.js HMR cache helps retain and update specific parts of the React component tree (DOM) instead of re-rendering the whole application. This makes the development experience much smoother and faster.

For example, imagine youâ€™re testing a premium API endpoint with a limited request quota. Without HMR, every small code edit would trigger a full page reload, repeatedly calling the API and exhausting your quota. 
HMR prevents this by updating only the changed components in memory â€” keeping the rest of the app state intact â€” so you can modify your code frequently without losing context or wasting network calls.

By default, Next.js enables HMR caching in development mode to ensure a seamless and efficient developer experience.

Wen you see something that is spread across diff pages in Next.js then we will need to put  it in the layout.tsx to spread across the page
